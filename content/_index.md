Yatta is a minimalistic, opiniated, (strongly) dynamically typed, strict, functional programming language, with ML-like syntax, for the [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) polyglot virtual machine (VM). Yatta puts a strong focus on code readability.

Yatta abstract users from dealing with non-blocking asynchronous computations and parallelism. While these features are commonly available in other languages nowadays, they are almost exclusively non-native solutions that come in forms of libraries or frameworks and are difficult to integrate with existing codebases. On top of that, dealing with these additional libraries requires conscious effort of the programmer to choose/learn/integrate these libraries into their mindset when writing new code.

# Documentation
Please see Yatta's documentation regarding the [standard library]({{< ref "/stdlib/overview" >}}). Plenty of demos can be found in [tests](https://github.com/yatta-lang/yatta/tree/master/language/tests).

Polyglot usage is explained in this [section]({{< ref "/polyglot" >}}).

# Status

# Examples

## Distributed calculation of PI using builtin HTTP Server and Client

    do
        port = 3000
        server = do
                iteration_handler = \params headers raw_body -> let
                    {"i" = i} = JSON::parse raw_body
                in (200, {"content-type" = "application/json"}, JSON::generate {"result" = (-1f ** (i + 1f)) / ((2f * i) - 1f)})

                max_connections = 100
                server = http\Server::create "127.0.0.1" port max_connections
                    |> http\Server::handle "/iteration" iteration_handler
                    |> http\Server::start
            end

        client_session = http\Client::session {}
        client_module = module Client exports run as
            send_request i = do
                    (200, _, raw_body) = http\Client::post client_session "http://localhost:{port}/iteration" {} <| JSON::generate {"i" = i}
                    {"result" = result} = JSON::parse raw_body
                    result
                end

            max_iterations = 1000
            run i acc
            | i >= max_iterations = acc
            | true = run (i + 1) (acc + (send_request <| float i))
        end

        4f * client_module::run 1 0f
    end

## Interoperability with Java

    let
        big_integer = Java::type "java.math.BigInteger"
        big_two = Java::new big_integer ["2"]
        big_three = Java::new big_integer ["3"]
        result = big_two::multiply big_three  # calling a method `multiply` on object of type BigInteger.
    in result::longValue
