Yatta provides following functions and modules as part of the standard library.

# Functions
* `println <value>` - Prints a value to the standard output
* `sleep <time unit tuple>` - Suspends computation by `<time unit tuple>`
* `timeout <time unit tuple> <value>` - Either the `<value>` is computed by the specified timeout, or a `:timeout` exception is raised
* `async <0-arg lambda>` - Executes the lambda asynchronously
* `identity <value>` - Returns the value provided to it as an argument, without any modification
* `str <value>` - Converts any value to its string representation
* `int <value>` - Converts any number to to int
* `float <value>` - Converts any value to float
* `eval <string>` - Dynamically evaluates the string as a Yatta expression
* `never` - Function that is never completed
* `read` - Reads a single character from standard input
* `readln` - Reads a line from the standard input
