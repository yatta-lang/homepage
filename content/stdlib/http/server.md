title: "Simple HTTP Server"

This module provides a simple HTTP Server built on top of `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer`.

## Usage
To create a server instance, one must first instantiate it using:

```haskell
    server = http\Server::create bind_address port backlog
```

Where the `backlog` is is the maximum number of queued incoming connections to allow on the listening socket. Queued TCP connections exceeding this limit may be rejected by the TCP implementation. If this value is less than or equal to zero, then a system default value is used.

Once instantiated, the route handlers should be added to the server instance:

```haskell
    server2 = http\Server::handle "/path" handler_function server
```

Handler function is a function of three arguments, specifically connection params, request headers and request body:
Connection params is a dictionary containing:
* `local_address`
* `protocol`
* `remote_address`
* `method`
* `uri`

Headers is a dictionary containing HTTP request headers and body is a sequence with the request body.
The handler function returns a triple of response code, response headers and response body.

Example handler function:

```haskell
    handler = \params headers raw_body -> let
        {"i" = i} = JSON::parse raw_body
    in (200, {"content-type" = "application/json"}, JSON::generate {"result" = i * 2})
```

Note that an uncaught exception thrown in the handler function results in server responding with response code 500 and exception details in the body of the response.

Last function of this module is a function `start` which takes the server instance after all routes have been initialized and starts listening for connections.

```haskell
    http\Server::start server
```

Using pipe operators, its possible to conveniently define server for example this way:

```haskell
    max_connections = 100
    server = http\Server::create "127.0.0.1" port max_connections
          |> http\Server::handle "/path" handler
          |> http\Server::start
```

A full example showing use of both HTTP server and client in an application for distributed PI computation can be seen in this [test case](https://github.com/yatta-lang/yatta/blob/master/language/tests/DistributedPiCalculation.yatta).
